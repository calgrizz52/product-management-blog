I got my job at Mazda North America - Research & Development around June 2018.
Cool. I'm working in an industry that I have a passion for, as well as
a company that i've admired since I first heard a rotary engine.

Step one in finding a more complete happiness and sense of self... Done.

Well... After a short couple of months,  I was told by my senior manager,
"go create a Clean Cockpit". Now i'm confused. I thought I was going to focus
of software development and system design... A definite curveball. 

What did that mean? "Clean Cockpit"
I had no clue about product management at the time. I was a budding software
developer. I started asking around about what I should do.
Thankfully I had some help from my cousin, who was attending UC Berkeley at
the time, getting his MBA.

Tip number one... 
"The ambiguity of the product management role is near to its essence."
Boy was I in for a ride, but it turned out to be a fun one and provided me
with a perspective that changed how I see technology and my entire career path.

I thought I had step one completed, but I had to take a step back and assess,
"What's the point in developing something if what i'm developing isn't truly
 solving a problem".
